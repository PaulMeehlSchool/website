### Course Description

Being able to simulate data allows you to prep analysis scripts for pre-registration, calculate power and sensitivity for analyses that donâ€™t have empirical methods, create reproducible examples when your data are too big or confidential to share, enhance your understanding of statistical concepts, create demo data for teaching and tutorials, and detect anomalies in statistical reporting. The first half of this workshop will introduce simulation using the R package `faux`. We will focus on simulating data from a mixed design where trials are crossed with subjects, analysing this using `lme4`, understanding how the simulation parameters correspond to the output, and using simulation to calculate power. The second half of this workshop will focus on using simulation to infer missing parameters and assess the plausibility of data from reported descriptive and inferential statistics

### Prerequisites 

A basic understanding of R is expected for this workshop. Make sure packages `faux`, `lme4`, `broom`, `afex`, and `tidyverse` are installed on your device.
