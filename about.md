Paul Meehl Graduate School is a center based at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) for graduate training focusing on quality and efficiency of scientific research. We set to encourage PhD students to critically examine the foundations, methodologies, and ethical frameworks underlying scientific practice. To this end, we offer training workshops on a veriaty of metascientific topics to provide a chance for PhD students to enhance their skills and engage in meaningful discussions. In Paul Meehl School, we are driven by the belief that education should be accessible to all who seek it. All workshops are delivered tuition-free to ensure financial barriers do not hinder participation.

This graduate school is named after Paul E. Meehl (1920 - 2003), an influential American psychologist who made seminal contributions to numerous domains of psychological theory, science, and practice. One of his lesser-known but significant contributions is his role in co-developing and extending metascience, the science of science, which is the focus of this graduate school.
