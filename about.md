The Paul Meehl Graduate School is a center based at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) for graduate training focused on improving the quality and efficiency of scientific research. We set to encourage PhD students to critically examine the foundations, methodologies, and ethical frameworks underlying scientific practice. To this end, we offer workshops on a variety of metascientific topics that provide PhD students with the opportunity to enhance their skills and engage in meaningful discussions with fellow metascientists. In the Paul Meehl Graduate School we are driven by the belief that education should be accessible to all who seek it. All workshops are delivered tuition-free to ensure financial barriers do not hinder participation.

The general board consists of Dr. Daniel Lakens, Dr. Vlasta SikimiÄ‡, Dr. Krist Vaesen, and Dr. Elena Mas Tur from Eindhoven University of Technology, Dr. Anna van 't Veer from Leiden University, and Dr. Noah van Dongen from the University of Amsterdam. 

This graduate school is named after Paul E. Meehl (1920 - 2003), an influential American psychologist who made seminal contributions in multiple research areas such as construct validity, philosophy of science, and psychological assessment. He was also an early contributor to the discipline of metascience through his criticisms on statistical practices and theory testing in psychology, and his development of the idea of cliometric metatheory. He also taught a course '[Philosophical Psychology](https://meehl.umn.edu/video)' that is an inspiration for this graduate school.
