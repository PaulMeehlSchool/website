Paul Meehl Graduate School is a center based at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) for graduate training focusing on quality and efficiency of scientific research. We set to encourage PhD students to critically examine the foundations, methodologies, and ethical frameworks underlying scientific practice. To this end, we offer training workshops on a veriaty of metascientific topics to provide a chance for PhD students to enhance their skills and engage in meaningful discussions. In Paul Meehl School, we are driven by the belief that education should be accessible to all who seek it. All workshops are delivered tuition-free to ensure financial barriers do not hinder participation.
