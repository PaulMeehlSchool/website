### Course Description

In this workshop we will discuss the perils and promises of meta-analysis. In the morning program Dr. Daniel Lakens will discuss the importance of meta-analytically evaluating sets of studies, and explain the basics of performing a meta-analysis in R. We will also discuss the challenges associated with meta-analyzing sets of very heterogenous studies. Meta-analyses are often of surprisingly low quality, and Cristian Mesquida Caldentey will discuss how to identify problems in meta-analysis, such as common coding errors and lack of reproducibility. 

In the afternoon program Dr. Robbie van Aert from Tilburg University will discuss the challenge of meta-analyzing a biased scientific literature, for example due to publication bias and selective reporting. He will provide a hands-on introduction to a range of bias detection techniques, such as the p-uniform method that he developed with his collaborators. 

### Prerequisites 

A basic understanding of R is expected, as we will use packages such as metafor and puniform during the hands-on part of the workshop.
