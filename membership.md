Interested PhD students can register for a free membership to the Paul Meehl Graduate School. Members have priority enrollment in the workshops.

**Criteria**

- You must be registered as a PhD student at a European university.

- The core idea of the graduate school is to offer graduate training free of charge, in a self-organized manner. We achieve this by asking supervisors of graduate students to assist in either teaching or organizing a workshop. We plan to organize 6 to 8 workshops a year. If we have 16 graduate students, we are self-supportive if every supervisor of a graduate student takes care of 1 lecture every other year, for the time their PhD student is enrolled. If you want to join the graduate school, but your supervisor can not help with teaching, we are very happy to discuss alternative ways in which you can help to make the graduate school self-sufficient. For example, you might want to help organize the yearly graduate conference meeting. You are also free to help organize a workshop yourself (with assistance from the graduate school board). Email us at <paulmeehlgraduateschool@tue.nl> to discuss options.
