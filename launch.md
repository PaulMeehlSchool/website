We are excited to announce the launch of the Paul Meehl Graduate School for Metascience hosted at Eindhoven University of Technology. With a growing number of interdepartmental collaborations between philosophers of science, psychologists, and innovation scientists, the need arose to provide high quality PhD education for the PhD students within these collaborations, as well as for other PhD students interested in improving the quality of scientific research. Our goal is to provide students with an overview of the state of the art in metascientific research through interactive workshops with international experts in the field of metascience. Workshops will focus on all aspects of the research cycle, from justifying research practices based on a philosophy of science, to theory building and measurement development, to high quality research methods and statistics. The approach to metascience in the Paul Meehl Graduate School is strongly grounded in social epistemology and explores the interaction between social behavior and scientific knowledge generation.
 
We plan to organize between 6 to 8 meetings a year, consisting of in-person workshops at Eindhoven University of Technology, as well as a yearly graduate school conference meeting where all PhD students can present their ongoing projects to peers. We expect regular workshop attendance from graduate school members, with the goal to create a network of early career metascientists. All workshops will also be open to non-graduate school members, free of charge, up to a maximum number of workshop participants.
 
The first four workshops have been prepared, and can be found on the website under [Workshops](workshops.md). We look forward to welcome all interested metascience PhD students to the Paul Meehl Graduate School.
