**ECTS**

The Paul Meehl Graduate School organizes approximately 6 workshops each year, and a yearly meeting where all members present their research projects. We use the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) for all activities in the teaching program. The average number of ECTS offered each year is 5. PhD students are free to choose which workshops they wish to attend. We expect regular attendance of PhD members as this will help to build a network of peers. 

It is important to note that ECTS credits will be assigned only upon the successful completion of the workshop. Students will receive certification for the number of ECTS they completed upon request at the end of each academic year.

**Registration**

You can register for each workshop on its dedicated page.  Workshops are also open to interested non-members, but please note that each workshop has limited capacity, and members of the Paul Meehl Graduate School have priority enrollment in the workshops. All members receive notifications upon the announcement of workshops. If you are not a member but wish to receive these notifications, please sign up for the [mailing list](https://1d66a74f.sibforms.com/serve/MUIFAJ56Wh_ZiEG2gq1O1CWBwSjTtrq798YhpcS4qFQwKyjE37cjuvk8LKsVXB-B-jVs1WqQpssPIM5NBbxsRkYJ5tur76Q2WxCgLJH88ZMWPxbh8l7z7OgOFqn5WADjijbUXWrPl8AePo4MnovDVkNXXKUM3VwwRn6t5d0i-o9bz0Akn4hV4DHCfQMUUFzys0MRPnfOu8yibXJD).
