**ECTS**

Paul Meehl School offers only one semester of workshops each year. We use the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) for all activities in the teaching program. The average number of ECTS offered each year is 5. PhD students are free to choose which workshops they wish to attend.

It is important to note that ECTS credits will be assigned only upon the successful completion of the workshop. By the end of the semester, each member will receive certification for the number of ECTS they completed that year.

**Registration**

You can register for each workshop on its dedicated page. Please note that each workshop has limited capacity, and members of Paul Meehl School have priority enrollment in the workshops.

If you have any questions, please contact us at [d.lakens@tue.nl](mailto:d.lakens@tue.nl).
