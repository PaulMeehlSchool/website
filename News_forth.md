We're excited to announce that registration is now open for the forth (and the last for this academic year) workshop of the Paul Meehl Graduate School. During the morning session, Lisa DeBruine will discuss the role of simulation in pre-registration, power calculation, and sensitivity analysis, along with hands-on simulations using R packages `faux` and `lme4`. The afternoon session will focus on using simulation to infer missing parameters and evaluate the plausibility of data derived from reported descriptive and inferential statistics. For further details about this workshop, click [here](simulation.md). Please note that the workshop will be **exclusively in-person**. We look forward to seeing you in Eindhoven on the 22nd of May!
