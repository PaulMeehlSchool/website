We are thrilled to announce that registration is now open for our new workshop. In this workshop, **Daniel Lakens**, **Paul Riesthuis**, and **ack Fitzgerald** will discuss the underlying rationale of interval hypothesis tests  and different approaches to specifying a smallest effect size of interest to test against in an equivalence test. This workshop also contains hands-on practices to perform equivalence tests, as well as more advance topics such as a-priori power analyses for interval hypothesis tests and three-sided hypothesis tests.
