### Course Description

Both epistemic (knowledge-related) and non-epistemic values (e.g., political and economic ones) play a role in science. Ideally, we wish science to be free of certain non-epistemic values. For instance, we do not want political orientation to strongly influence one's research. On the other hand, we want and expect scientists to follow certain ethical values. We will first analyze the interplay between complex networks of values in science. Then, we will zoom in on values important for increasing the global pool of scientific knowledge such as diversity. Diversity of thoughts and approaches contributes to exploring a wider epistemic space. In other words, using diverse methods allows us to find creative solutions outside the mainstream. Yet, in order to profit from diversity, appropriate ways of including different expertise are needed. We will present how group structure and degrees of diversity influence the exploration of epistemic space based on the results of agent-based models.

In the afternoon session, our goal is to identify ways of fostering epistemic inclusion for research. Participants will reflect on examples of important research by underprivileged scientists and their experience of the academic culture. We will build a suggestion map for its improvement.

### Prerequisites 

Think of an example of research from underprivileged researchers that later became very important in your field.
