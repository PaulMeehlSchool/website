We are thrilled to announce the first workshop of the Paul Meehl Graduate School for Metascience. The workshop will be co-taught be Robbie van Aert (Tilburg University) and Daniel Lakens (Eindhoven University of Technology). During the workshop we will discuss how to perform a state of the art meta-analysis, and discuss the challenge of heterogeneity in the literature for the conclusions that can be drawn. Cristian Mesquida Caldentey will report on the difficulties of reproducing meta-analyses, including common errors inexperienced meta-analysts make. In the afternoon Dr. Robbie van Aert will discuss to use and limitations of state of the art bias detection techniques.
You can sign up for the course by completing the registration form. Note that we offer priority to studies who register as Paul Meehl Graduate School members. Registration is free, but one of your supervisors need to commit to organizing or teaching a workshop once every other year.
We look forward to seeing you in Eindhoven on the 22nd of February!
